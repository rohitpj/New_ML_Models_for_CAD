# New ML Models for CAD
Accompanying code for Rohit John's 3rd year dissertation titled "Exploring Alternative Machine Learning Models for Variable Ordering in Cylindrical Algebraic Decomposition"
Please note that all code for this project was originally written and run using Google Colab, and so certain parts of the code will reflect that. An updated version for Windows will be released soon alongside the datatsets used and the code for generating them.

If you have any questions then please feel free to email me at rpj31@bath.ac.uk
